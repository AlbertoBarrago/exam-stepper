> For an "exam stepper" application, sending responses to the server after each step is generally the better and more robust approach.

Here's why:

- Data Persistence and Safety: This is the most critical factor for an exam. If the user's browser crashes, they lose internet connection, or accidentally close the tab, their progress is saved up to the last completed step. Storing everything locally until the end risks
  losing all their work.
- Improved User Experience: Users can resume the exam from where they left off, which is crucial for longer exams.
- Real-time Validation/Feedback: If needed, the server can provide immediate feedback or validation for each step, rather than waiting until the entire exam is submitted.
- Scalability: For very long exams, storing all answers in the client's memory can become an issue. Sending them incrementally reduces client-side memory burden.
- Tracking Progress: It allows for better tracking of user progress on the server side.
